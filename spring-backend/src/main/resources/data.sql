Self preservation, self elevation
These kind of things they deserve celebration
No hesitation, no reservation
Go for the big leagues, no relegation
Let''s celebrate life
Kick back and take five
And give thanks to the source that create life
To see a sun set or see a sun rise
And see my son born with these same eyes
To see my son smile, brighten every grey sky
He''s growing so fast, that''s why everyday I give it one hundred, nuh stop at 90
Praise the Almighty, the Father anoint me
Say tonight, man feeling blessed oh
Say tonight, me and my guys we go jam gbedu
Whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa
Say tonight, man no go stress oh
Say tonight, me and my guys we go jam gbedu
Whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa
Yeah-yo
Truly
Make I tell you say my life is like a movie
And if I tell you all these things I don see truly
See my eyes don see, before my life come be
Say many try to fool me
But I dey pray for my enemies, and truly
And I dey pray for my kids, that''s my blessings
Pray for the friends I lost
I pray you never see no loss (yeah)
''Cause one pressure, fit turn two pressure
Ah, I don see where pressure make man wreck oh (yes)
So, make you live your life o jeje, no regret am (ah)
When man pressure, na God give rest o');
